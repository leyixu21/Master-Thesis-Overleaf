	abstract = {This paper describes a framework which has been designed for a comparative study of the social impacts of tourism in destination communities along the eastern seaboard of Australia. As this part of Australia is experiencing the most rapid population growth and at the same time encompasses the focus of tourist activity in the country, it is expected that the tension between tourism and urban development demands will become more pronounced in the future.Theframework is tested through an application to a case study involving one of Australia s most well known seaside resorts, the Gold Coast. While the Gold Coast survey of resident reactions revealed some relationships between variations in perceptions of tourism s impacts and background characteristics such as involvement in tourism, residential proximity to tourist activity and period of residence, the most notable feature of resident reactions in this case is the generally positive view of tourism s role in the region. It is therefore concluded that the altruistic surplus phenomenon observed in urban planning research may apply to tourism. In the tourism context, the altruistic surplus concept suggests that individuals tolerate any downside effects of tourism they might experience personally because they recognise the broader community wide benefits of this activity. The Gold Coast study also suggests that, contrary to the Doxey scenario, residents in large scale mature tourist destinations do not become more antagonistic towards tourism.},

	abstract = {A supply-side definition of the tourism industry is proposed. The definition is based on recognizing two tiers of tourism businesses: a tier composed of businesses that serve exclusively tourists and a tier composed of businesses that serve a mix of tourists and local residents. These tiers are operationally defined from several Statistics Canada data sources and the Standard Industrial Classification codes. A key strength of this definition is that it permits both conceptualization and measurement of tourism in a way that is consistent with other economic activity. Application of the definition to available 1981/82 data sources resulted in an estimate of the size of Canadian tourism, four times as large as forestry, slightly larger than agriculture, and just under automobile manufacturing.
Résumé
Pour une définition du tourisme: une perspective du marché de l'offre. On propose une définition de l'industrie touristique du côté du marché de l'offre. Cette définition est basée sur l'identification de deux couches d'entreprises touristiques: une couche qui se compose d'entreprises qui sont exclusivement au service des touristes, et une autre couche d'entreprises qui servent un mélange de touristes et d'habitants locaux. L'identification de ces deux couches a été faite de façon opérationnelle, à partir de plusieurs sources de données statistiques canadiennes et à partir de la Classification industrielle standard. Un avantage clef de cette définition est qu'elle permet une conceptualisation aussi bien qu'un mesurage du tourisme qui sont compatibles avec d'autres activités économiques. Une application de la définition aux sources de données disponibles a produit une estimation de l'ampleur du tourisme canadien, qui est quatre fois plus grand que la sylviculture, un peu plus grand que l'agriculture et à peine moins important que l'industrie automobile.},

	abstract = {The postwar restructuring of small tropical islands toward mass tourism development has threatened their sustainability. A major cause has been inadequate understanding of tourism dynamics and the absence of comprehensive integrated measures of tourism's pervasive economic, social, and environmental impacts. This paper constructs a composite Tourism Penetration Index from per capita visitor spending, daily visitor densities per 1,000 population, and hotel rooms per square kilometer. It is tested on 20 small Caribbean islands and yields three levels of increasing penetration. Four case studies are presented to illustrate the behavior of islands at different levels of penetration and to highlight the policy implications for Dominica, St. Lucia, Antigua/Barbuda, and St. Maarten/St. Martin.

Une cause principale est la compréhension insuffisante de la dynamique du tourisme et le défaut de mesures intégrées des impacts économiques, sociaux et environnementaux du tourisme. Cette étude bâtit un Index de la Pénétration du Tourisme selon les dépenses par visiteur, la densité quotidienne de visiteurs et les chambres d'hôtel par kilomètre carré. Un test de l'index pour vingt petites îles caraïbes a révélé trois niveaux de pénétration. Quatre études de cas sont présentées pour illustrer le comportement des îles à différents niveaux de pénétration et souligner les implications pour Dominique, Sainte-Lucie, Antigua et Barbuda et Saint-Martin.},

	abstract = {International tourism is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Understanding the variety of national and local impacts of this increase is of importance to a growing number of governments. Butler's resort cycle model (1974, 1980, 1991) provides for several long-term possibilities as to the relationship between crowding and growth. McElroy, de Albuquerque, and Dioguardi (1993) focus on one of those possibilities. Specifically, using their penetration ratio, they predict that as tourist crowding continues for a group of Caribbean islands, the appeal of these islands decreases in the eyes of potential tourists and that, as time increases, the growth rate of the affected islands, actually decreases. Our article indicates that such a simple, straight-line relationship between increased crowding and a decrease in the rate of change may not be inevitable; indeed, diseconomies of scale may be avoided. The use of a curvilinear regression function reveals how both positive and negative scale economies existed in the Caribbean during the years 1992 through 1996.},

Using an inductive approach, their responses were coded for themes of reported psychological benefits. Thirteen categories of benefits were revealed: memories, belonging, relaxation, positive emotions, activity support, comfort-security, personal growth, freedom, entertainment, connection to nature, practical benefits, privacy, and aesthetics. Variations in the reported benefits were explored as a function of place type, geographical scale, and demographic characteristics.

R., \& Vaske, J. J. (2003). The measurement of place attachment: Validity and generalisability of a psychometric approach. Forest Science, 49(6), 830–840] and a map-based measure derived from mapped special places [Brown, G. (2005). Mapping spatial attributes in survey research for natural resource management: Methods and applications. Society and Natural Resources, 18(1), 17–39]. We first examine the external validity of a two-dimensional, psychometric place attachment scale in Australia and its relationship with place-based landscape values. The place attachment scale and landscape value measures were included in a mail survey of residents and visitors to the Otways region (Victoria, Australia). Exploratory factor analysis of resident subgroups and visitors demonstrate the place attachment scale consists of two dimensions with high reliability. We use regression analysis to show that landscape importance values, especially spiritual and wilderness values, are significant predictors of the scale-based measure of place attachment. We then examine the relationship between a map-based measure of place attachment and landscape values. We use spatial cross-correlation and regression analyses to show that aesthetic, recreation, economic, spiritual, and therapeutic values spatially co-locate with special places and thus likely contribute to place attachment. We argue that survey mapping of landscape values and special places provides a reasonable proxy for scale-based measures of place attachment while providing richer, place-based information for land use planning. We conclude by introducing the concept of a map-based place attachment index and suggest that survey-based measures of landscape values and special places can be used to assess the risk associated with landscape modification. We provide a map showing one possible place attachment index for the Otways region and discuss its potential application.},

To accomplish this, in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 participants in the New York metropolitan area. Qualitative analysis reveals the diversity and richness of people's emotional relationships to places, indicating that place meaning develops from an array of emotions and experiences, both positive and negative. Moreover, findings demonstrate the socio-political underpinnings of our emotional relationships to places, particularly the impact of gender, race, class and sexuality, suggesting a need to further incorporate the full magnitude of the human experience into the current discourse on people–place relationships.},

Sense-of-place research, which considers how people connect with places and the influence of those connections on engagement with the environment, may have important implications for environmental education. Prior place studies have proposed that people’s place connections have various dimensions. This paper explores four place dimensions, analyzing data from a survey (n = 712) conducted in three ecoregional sites in which we investigated residents’ sense of place. We examine how our data fit a proposed typology of place dimensions – a four-dimension (biophysical, psychological, sociocultural, and political-economic) categorization based on previous conceptions of the dimensions of place. We use structural equation modeling to question whether a 4-factor conceptualization of the dimensions of sense of place is superior to plausible alternatives. In comparing the four-dimension model with alternative models, we find that the four-dimension model is the best fit for these data. Our findings suggest that environmental and place-based education may benefit from an understanding and consideration of this four-dimension conceptualization of place in program design, implementation, and evaluation.},

	abstract = {Sense of place can be conceived as a multidimensional construct representing beliefs, emotions and behavioural commitments concerning a particular geographic setting. This view, grounded in attitude theory, can better reveal complex relationships between the experience of a place and attributes of that place than approaches that do not differentiate cognitive, affective and conative domains. Shoreline property owners (N=290) in northern Wisconsin were surveyed about their sense of place for their lakeshore properties. A predictive model comprising owners' age, length of ownership, participation in recreational activities, days spent on the property, extent of property development, and perceptions of environmental features, was employed to explain the variation in dimensions of sense of place. In general, the results supported a multidimensional approach to sense of place in a context where there were moderate to high correlations among the three place dimensions. Perceptions of environmental features were the biggest predictors of place dimensions, with owners' perceptions of lake importance varying in explanatory power across place dimensions.},

	abstract = {Crime is a complex social issue impacting a considerable number of individuals within a society. Preventing and reducing crime is a top priority in many countries. Given limited policing and crime reduction resources, it is often crucial to identify effective strategies to deploy the available resources. Towards this goal, crime hotspot prediction has previously been suggested. Crime hotspot prediction leverages past data in order to identify geographical areas susceptible of hosting crimes in the future. However, most of the existing techniques in crime hotspot prediction solely use historical crime records to identify crime hotspots, while ignoring the predictive power of other data such as urban or social media data. In this paper, we propose CrimeTelescope, a platform that predicts and visualizes crime hotspots based on a fusion of different data types. Our platform continuously collects crime data as well as urban and social media data on the Web. It then extracts key features from the collected data based on both statistical and linguistic analysis. Finally, it identifies crime hotspots by leveraging the extracted features, and offers visualizations of the hotspots on an interactive map. Based on real-world data collected from New York City, we show that combining different types of data can effectively improve the crime hotspot prediction accuracy (by up to 5.2\%), compared to classical approaches based on historical crime records only. In addition, we demonstrate the usability of our platform through a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey on a full prototype of CrimeTelescope.},

Urban big data and data-driven technologies have played an increasingly important role in building smart and resilient cities that can respond rapidly to these perturbations. However, many existing approaches had limited capabilities for processing big data, which has led to time-consuming and costly decision-making. Thus, we develop a real-time data-driven analytical and geo-visual system to enable smart and rapid responses to urban extreme events. The system is built on ArcGIS’s GeoEvent Server and Apache Spark and processes streaming data from social media with high speed, massive volume, and multiple modalities. The system employs online topic modeling and domain-adaptive sentiment analysis to track small-scale, undefined events, visualizes their spatial and semantic dynamics, and provides early alerts for crises and emergencies via an interactive online GIS platform. The proposed system has been applied during a large-scale hurricane and demonstrated effectiveness and agility in tracking and reporting emerging small-scale crises. The developed system can be applied in various urban scenarios to enable timely situation awareness and rapid response. This research contributes to the smart city safety and building rapidity of resilient cities.},

Second, we bridge UGC and professional-generated content (PGC), in order to take advantage of both sides. The third application links multi-sourced UGC to uncover urban spatial structures and human dynamics. We suggest that UGC data contain rich information in diverse aspects. In addition, analysis of sentiment from geotagged texts and photos, along with the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods, is discussed to help understand the linkage between human emotions and surrounding environments. Drawing on the analyses, we summarize a number of future research areas that call for attention in urban informatics.},

As a result, users often find it challenging to discover useful information or more on the topic being discussed from such content. Machine learning and natural language processing algorithms are used to analyze the massive amount of textual social media data available online, including topic modeling techniques that have gained popularity in recent years. This paper investigates the topic modeling subject and its common application areas, methods, and tools. Also, we examine and compare five frequently used topic modeling methods, as applied to short textual social data, to show their benefits practically in detecting important topics. These methods are latent semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, non-negative matrix factorization, random projection, and principal component analysis. Two textual datasets were selected to evaluate the performance of included topic modeling methods based on the topic quality and some standard statistical evaluation metrics, like recall, precision, F-score, and topic coherence. As a result, latent Dirichlet allocation and non-negative matrix factorization methods delivered more meaningful extracted topics and obtained good results. The paper sheds light on some common topic modeling methods in a short-text context and provides direction for researchers who seek to apply these methods.},

In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis.},

We present different topic modeling approaches capable of dealing with correlation between topics, the changes of topics over time, as well as the ability to handle short texts such as encountered in social media or sparse text data. We also briefly review the algorithms which are used to optimize and infer parameters in topic modeling, which is essential to producing meaningful results regardless of method.

Trajectory data are normally available as sample points, and do not carry se- mantic information, which is of fundamental importance for the comprehension of these data. Therefore, the analysis of trajectory data becomes expensive from a computational point of view and complex from a user's perspective. En- riching trajectories with semantic geographical information may simplify queries, analysis, and mining of moving ob- ject data. In this paper we propose a data preprocessing model to add semantic information to trajectories in order to facilitate trajectory data analysis in dierent application domains. The model is generic enough to represent the im- portant parts of trajectories that are relevant to the appli- cation, not being restricted to one specic application. We present an algorithm to compute the important parts and show that the query complexity for the semantic analysis of trajectories will be signicantly reduced with the proposed model.},

Data from Flickr and Twitter with 30″ spatial resolution were obtained from four South Korean regions. Coastal tourism hotspots were then derived using Getis-Ord Gi. Comparing the derived hotspot maps with the visitation rate distribution maps, the derived hotspot maps sufficiently identified the spatial influences of visitors and tourist attractions applicable for spatial planning. As the spatial autocorrelation of social media data differs based on the spatial unit, coastal tourism hotspots according to spatial unit are inevitably different. Spatial hotspots derived from the appropriate spatial unit using social media data are useful for coastal tourism spatial planning.},

	abstract = {The present study analyses the effects of the physical characteristics of the visual landscape on soundscape perception in city parks, based on information gathered in field surveys using a specifically designed soundwalk method in five city parks in China. Three soundscape parameters were conceived, including perceived loudness of individual sounds (PLS), perceived occurrences of individual sounds (POS) and soundscape diversity index (SDI), which were found to correlate and should thus be applied in concert. Physical characteristics of the visual landscape were analysed from two perspectives, i.e., by on-site landscape composition and local landscape spatial patterns. The results suggest that the percentage of buildings, vegetation and sky in panoramic views (here photos) were effective landscape elements influencing soundscape perception. The landscape shape index of buildings and water areas (LSI\_B, LSI\_W) and the patch cohesion index of water areas (COHESION\_W) showed positive effects on the perception of human sounds. The percentage of roads (PLAND\_R) and the largest patch index of roads (LPI\_R) were related to traffic sounds. Both the PLS and POS of biological sounds were negatively related to LPI\_W and LSI\_B, respectively, whilst the POS of biological sounds was positively related to PLAND\_R, and LSI\_R. COHESION\_R was the only index negatively related to both the PLS and POS of geophysical sounds. SDI only showed positive relationship with PLAND\_W. Overall, the results reveal that local landscape spatial patterns could be more influential on soundscape perception than on-site landscape composition. The study proposed introducing soundscape information from different sources into landscape management.},

	abstract = {We investigated relationships between adolescents’ perceptions of their neighbourhood, their mental health and independently assessed indicators of conditions in their residential neighbourhood. The Research with East London Adolescents Community Health Survey (RELACHS) provided information for 2370 adolescents on area perceptions (specifically alienation from/attachment to the area and satisfaction/dissatisfaction with local amenities and services), and on individual and family attributes including mental distress (measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). These were combined for this study with independently assessed small area geographical indicators proposed by government to measure local deprivation in England. A Bayesian regression analysis using Gibbs sampling investigated associations between the predictor variables and neighbourhood perception. Alienation from neighbourhood and dissatisfaction with local amenities was greater for girls than for boys and for the older adolescents sampled. Those of ‘Asian’ or ‘Black’ ethnicity, from relatively harmonious families, or with higher levels of social support were less likely to express negative area perceptions. While previously published research found no significant direct association between mental health and small area indicators, this analysis suggests that those with relatively high levels of distress did have worse area perceptions. Also, certain independently assessed area indicators were associated with adolescents’ views of their neighbourhood.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Parks provide places for people to experience nature, engage in physical activity, and relax. We studied how residents in low-income, minority communities use public, urban neighborhood parks and how parks contribute to physical activity.
            Methods. In 8 public parks, we used direct observation to document the number, gender, race/ethnicity, age group, and activity level of park users 4 times per day, 7 days per week. We also interviewed 713 park users and 605 area residents living within 2 miles of each park.
            Results. On average, over 2000 individuals were counted in each park, and about two thirds were sedentary when observed. More males than females used the parks, and males were twice as likely to be vigorously active. Interviewees identified the park as the most common place they exercised. Both park use and exercise levels of individuals were predicted by proximity of their residence to the park.
            Conclusions. Public parks are critical resources for physical activity in minority communities. Because residential proximity is strongly associated with physical activity and park use, the number and location of parks are currently insufficient to serve local populations well.},

We surveyed 3815 adults living within 0.80?km of one of 24 study parks in four US metropolitan areas. Chi-square statistics and baseline-category logit models examined how perceived safety and park characteristics were related to park visitation and types of park activities, controlling for city, individual and park characteristics. Survey participants who perceived the parks as safe (88\%) had 4.6 times the odds (95\% CI 3.5?6.0) of reporting having visited the study park. Men and African Americans were more likely, and older individuals and those who self-reported being in fair or poor health less likely to perceive parks as safe. Parks having low incivilities scores and those with four or more different facilities, such as tennis courts, swimming pools, basketball courts, etc., were more likely than parks with fewer facilities to be perceived as safe. While park facilities had a much smaller odds ratio for predicting park visits (1.8), it affected 70\% of the population. The implication is, if these associations are causal, modifying park facilities may have a greater population impact than improving perceptions of park safety. Our findings are consistent with studies suggesting that increasing the variety of park facilities and offering more organised activities may encourage physical activity among specific target groups.},

	abstract = {A number of studies have been initiated to explore how to improve the soundscape quality in urban parks. However, good soundscape quality in parks cannot be provided without a thorough understanding of the complex relationships among sound, environment, and individuals. As acoustic comfort is considered to be an important outcome of soundscape quality, this study investigates the relative impacts of the factors influencing acoustic comfort evaluation by formulating a multivariate ordered logit model. This study also explores the inter-relationships among acoustic comfort evaluation, acceptability of the environment, and preference to stay in a park using a path model. A total of 595 valid responses were obtained from interview surveys administered in four parks in Hong Kong while objective sound measurements were carried out at the survey spots concurrently. The findings unveil that acoustic comfort evaluation, besides visual comfort evaluation of landscape, also plays an important role on users’ acceptability of the urban park environment. Compared with all the studied acoustic related factors, acoustic comfort evaluation serves as a better proxy for park users’ preference to stay in urban parks. Hearing the breeze will significantly increase the likelihood of individuals in giving high acoustic comfort evaluation. Conversely, hearing the sounds from heavy vehicles or sounds from bikes will significantly reduce the likelihood in giving a high acoustic evaluation.},

	abstract = {The social profiles of residential communities exert differential effects on expectations and demands on urban greenspaces. We studied the diversity of public perception towards urban greenspaces in compact urban Hong Kong. Random household samples were selected from four dominant residential communities: old-core public housing (OP), old-core residential (OR), suburban residential (SR), and new-town public housing (NP). They denote gradations in income, housing quality, physical and social milieu, and development age. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Residents’ attitude, visiting pattern, greenspace preference, and assessment of neighborhood quality were investigated. SR presented distinctive results in comparison with others. The moderate differences between the remaining three communities were mainly linked to local traits in park environs. OP more emphasized the function of communal places for neighborly interactions associated with better social relationship of an older population. Parks in OR were the more frequently visited, even though its residents were sensitive to the negative impacts of urban greenspaces, which was related to urban blight in the environs. SR respondents highly appreciated greenspaces as pleasant settings for family activities and aesthetic enjoyment. NP residents were less frequent visitors despite generous park provision, due to the youthful population, weak social cohesion, and limited integration of new migrants. Community quality factors such as neighborhood relationship and urban density influenced the perception. Social qualities were more important than the physical aspects of parks in influencing visitorship. The findings suggest future research to deepen understanding of public perception towards urban greenspaces to inform park design.},

	abstract = {In the last few years trajectory classiﬁcation has been applied to many real problems, basically considering the dimensions of space and time or attributes inferred from these dimensions. However, with the explosion of social media data and the advances in the semantic enrichment of mobility data, a new type of trajectory data has emerged, and the trajectory spatio-temporal points have now multiple and heterogeneous semantic dimensions. By semantic dimensions we mean any type of information that is neither spatial nor temporal. As a consequence, new classiﬁcation methods are needed to deal with this new type of data. The main challenge is how to automatically select and combine the data dimensions and to discover the subtrajectories that better discriminate the class. In this paper we propose MasterMovelets, a new parameter-free method for trajectory classiﬁcation which ﬁnds the best trajectory partition and dimension combination for robust high dimensional trajectory classiﬁcation. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by reducing the classiﬁcation error up to 63\%, indicating that our proposal is very promising for multidimensional sequence data classiﬁcation.},

For the purpose of this paper ‘danger’ was assessed by studying how safe, relaxed, vulnerable, threatened, and at risk people felt while in London. The study found a number of similarities and differences between the men and women studied, in terms of how they perceived danger and their group composition during the day and nighttime. These results indicate that gender may not be the only influence on perception and behaviour, and that men and women should not be regarded as homogenous cohorts.},

This research investigates to what extent the anonymized data collected from social networks can be used as a basis for making activity recommendations associated with local residents versus tourists when visiting a public place, such as a museum or gallery. Using rules based on the spatial, temporal and semantics of visited places, we are able to infer if a user is likely to be local or a tourist, based on anonymous sample Foursquare data and place-based semantics retrieved using Google Places API. Using semantics of visited places, it becomes possible to infer additional information about a user based on their movements over space and time. Depending on the kind and frequency of visited places, inferences about the aim of a visit to a location are possible. This analysis could provide information to users in the form of recommendations based on their movements while travelling around an area.

In this paper we propose WhereNext, which is a method aimed at predicting with a certain level of accuracy the next location of a moving object. The prediction uses previously extracted movement patterns named Trajectory Patterns, which are a concise representation of behaviors of moving objects as sequences of regions frequently visited with a typical travel time. A decision tree, named T-pattern Tree, is built and evaluated with a formal training and test process. The tree is learned from the Trajectory Patterns that hold a certain area and it may be used as a predictor of the next location of a new trajectory finding the best matching path in the tree. Three dierent best matching methods to classify a new moving object are proposed and their impact on the quality of prediction is studied extensively. Using Trajectory Patterns as predictive rules has the following implications: (I) the learning depends on the movement of all available objects in a certain area instead of on the individual history of an object; (II) the prediction tree intrinsically contains the spatio-temporal properties that have emerged from the data and this allows us to define matching methods that striclty depend on the properties of such movements. In addition, we propose a set of other measures, that evaluate a priori the predictive power of a set of Trajectory Patterns. This measures were tuned on a real life case study. Finally, an exhaustive set of experiments and results on the real dataset are presented.},

	abstract = {Web data is the most prominent source of information for deciding where to go and what to do. Exploiting this source for geographic analysis, however, does not come without difficulties. First, in recent years, the amount and diversity of available Web information about urban space have exploded, and it is therefore increasingly difficult to overview and exploit. Second, the bulk of information is in an unstructured form which is difficult to process and interpret by computers. Third, semi-structured sources, such as Web rankings, geolocated tags, check-ins, or mobile sensor data, do not fully reflect the more subtle qualities of a place, including the particular functions that make it attractive. In this article, we explore a method to capture leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space using semantic topic models. We test three supervised multi-label machine learning strategies exploiting geolocated webtexts and place tags to estimate whether a given type of leisure activity is afforded or not. We train and validate these models on a manually curated dataset labeled with leisure ontology classes for the city of Zwolle, and discuss their potential for urban leisure and tourism research and related city policies and planning. We found that multi-label affordance estimation is not straightforward but can be made to work using both official webtexts and user-generated content on a medium semantic level. This opens up new opportunities for data-driven approaches to urban leisure and tourism studies.},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of location aware social media provides a unique opportunity to study individual knowledge of the environment, e.g., individual familiarity with places. With Foursquare being one of the most popular location-based social media, in this paper, we focus on ranking individual familiarity with places using Foursquare check-in data. Our method firstly identifies individually meaningful places. Then, the identified meaningful places are ranked according to individual’s familiarity with them, i.e., the weighting that we assigned to each place based on the information indicated by the tagging activities. Results of the evaluation demonstrate the possibility of ranking individual familiarity with places using location-based social media.},

The “call eﬀect” for having the World Heritage status has boosted tourism in many cities. The large number of visitors and the side eﬀects, such as the overcrowding of central spaces, are arousing the need to develop and protect heritage assets. Hence, the analysis of tourist spatial behaviour is critical for tackling the needs of touristiﬁed cities correctly. In this article, individual visitor spatiotemporal trajectories are reconstructed along with the urban network using thousands of geotagged Flickr photos taken by visitors in the historic centre of the World Heritage City of Toledo (Spain). A process of trajectory reconstruction using advanced GIS techniques has been implemented. The spatial behaviour has been used to classify the tourist sites oﬀered on the city’s oﬃcial tourist map, as well as to identify the association with the land uses. Results bring new knowledge to understand visitor spatial behaviour and new visions about the inﬂuence of the urban environment and its uses on the visitor spatial behaviour. Our ﬁndings illustrate how tourist attractions and the location of mixed commercial and recreational uses shape the visitor spatial behaviour. Overﬂowed streets and shadow areas underexplored by visitors are pinpointed.},

Many aspects of critical urban infrastructure are closely coupled with the human communities that they serve. Urban communities are composed of a multiplex of overlapping factors which can be distinguished into cultural, religious, social-economic, political, and geographical layers. In this paper, we review how increasingly available heterogeneous mobile big data sets can be leveraged to detect the community interaction structure using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. A number of community layer and interaction detection algorithms are then reviewed, with a particular focus on robustness, stability, and causality of evolving communities. The better understanding of the structural dynamics and multiplexed relationships can provide useful information to inform both urban planning policies and shape the design of socially coupled urban infrastructure systems, such as socially-driven computing and communication networks.},

However, limited efforts have been devoted to understanding these patterns and the travel intentions behind them. This study proposes a new trajectory topic model (TTM) to explore latent driving patterns from driving trajectory data and to qualitatively analyze drivers’ main traveling intentions. These trajectory data were collected from more than 150,000 commercial vehicles in Fujian Province, China. After data preprocessing, the TTM was then established to decompose trajectory data into various topics with corresponding probabilities, which were correlated to drivers’ preferences. Several experiments conducted in Fuzhou City were performed to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the TTM using a real trajectory dataset. The results show that the TTM could effectively mine users’ driving behavior patterns with topic probability. The model would enable us to understand the context in which drivers travel and learn their individual preferences. It is also beneficial in that it can predict drivers’ behaviors, analyze traffic patterns in an entire city, and even help autonomous vehicles to learn from drivers.},

In this setting, we provide a general formal statement of the novel mining problem and then study several different instantiations of different complexity.

In the context of multiple-aspect trajectories, where mobility data are enriched with several semantic dimensions, current state-of-the-art approaches present some limitations concerning the relationships between attributes and their semantics. Existing works are either too strict, requiring a match on all attributes, or too flexible, considering all attributes as independent. In this article we propose MUITAS, a novel similarity measure for a new type of trajectory data with heterogeneous semantic dimensions, which takes into account the semantic relationship between attributes, thus filling the gap of the current trajectory similarity methods. We evaluate MUITAS over two real datasets of multiple-aspect social media and GPS trajectories. With precision at recall and clustering techniques, we show that MUITAS is the most robust measure for multiple-aspect trajectories.},

We reason that the photographers typically capture a scene or a moment because they want to remember or share it, thus these scenes or moments are meaningful to them. Various scholars suggest that the human experience (i.e. this meaningfulness) is what separates a place from the mathematical descriptions of space. While this notion is well known in larger geographic literature, it is under-explored in cartographic research. We respond to this research gap and reconstruct static and dynamic patterns of photo-taking and -sharing behaviour to assist in capturing the implicit meaning in the studied locations. These locations may be meaningful to only a certain group of people in certain moments; therefore, studying group differences in spatial and temporal photo-taking patterns will help building a collective and comparative story about the studied place. In our study, we focus on experiences of foreign versus domestic visitors, and in the process, we examine the potential (and feasibility) of georeferenced photographs for extracting such collective narratives using qualitative and quantitative visual analytical methods.},

Tourism systems like the Danube Region are composed of several local and regional destinations, and even when these are branded together for tourists the integration of these into one system is often compromised by national boundaries and socio-economic differences. This study shows how the Danube region is composed of different clusters of destinations, and how national boundaries have a strong shielding effect in the interregional movements of tourists. A methodology based on network analysis with efﬁcient clustering algorithms applied on large geotagged datasets from User Generated Content is proposed. Flickr data was used to map short time-interval visitor ﬂows along the linear system of the river Danube. 18 regional clusters integrated into 3 strong, but separated destination systems were identiﬁed by modularity analysis. The central integrating effect of the large capital cities and the boundary-shielding effect impeding the total integration of this large-scale system were made measurable.},

	abstract = {With the increasing use of GPS-enabled mobile phones, geo-tagging, which refers to adding GPS information to media such as micro-blogging messages or photos, has seen a surge in popularity recently. This enables us to not only browse information based on locations, but also discover patterns in the location-based behaviors of users. Many techniques have been developed to find the patterns of people's movements using GPS data, but latent topics in text messages posted with local contexts have not been utilized effectively. In this paper, we present a latent topic-based clustering algorithm to discover patterns in the trajectories of geo-tagged text messages. We propose a novel probabilistic model to capture the semantic regions where people post messages with a coherent topic as well as the patterns of movement between the semantic regions. Based on the model, we develop an efficient inference algorithm to calculate model parameters. By exploiting the estimated model, we next devise a clustering algorithm to find the significant movement patterns that appear frequently in data. Our experiments on real-life data sets show that the proposed algorithm finds diverse and interesting trajectory patterns and identifies the semantic regions in a finer granularity than the traditional geographical clustering methods.},

We apply this new methodology to data from approximately 18 million check-ins collected from users of a location-based online social network. Unlike the boundaries of traditional municipal organizational units such as neighborhoods, which do not always reﬂect the character of life in these areas, our clusters, which we call Livehoods, are representations of the dynamic areas that comprise the city. We take a qualitative approach to validating these clusters, interviewing 27 residents of Pittsburgh, PA, to see how their perceptions of the city project onto our ﬁndings there. Our results provide strong support for the discovered clusters, showing how Livehoods reveal the distinctly characterized areas of the city and the forces that shape them.},

	abstract = {In his classic book “The Image of the City” Kevin Lynch used empirical work to show how diﬀerent elements of the city were perceived: such as paths, landmarks, districts, edges, and nodes. Streets, by providing paths from which cities can be experienced, were argued to be one of the key elements of cities. Despite this long standing empirical basis, and the importance of Lynch's model in policy associated areas such as planning, work with user generated content has largely ignored these ideas. In this paper, we address this gap, using streets to aggregate ﬁltered user generated content related to more than 1 million images and 60,000 individuals and explore similarity between more than 3000 streets in London across three dimensions: user behaviour, time and semantics. To perform our study we used two diﬀerent sources of user generated content: (1) a collection of metadata attached to Flickr images and (2) street network of London from OpenStreetMap. We ﬁrst explore global patterns in the distinctiveness and spatial autocorrelation of similarity using our three dimensions, establishing that the semantic and user dimensions in particular allow us to explore the city in diﬀerent ways. We then used a Processing tool to interactively explore individual patterns of similarity across these four dimensions simultaneously, presenting results here for four selected and contrasting locations in London. Before drilling into the data to interpret in more detail, the identiﬁed patterns demonstrate that streets are natural units capturing perception of cities not only as paths but also through the emergence of other elements of the city proposed by Lynch including districts, landmarks and edges. Our approach also demonstrates how user generated content can be captured, allowing bottom-up perception from citizens to ﬂow into a representation.},

In addition, the existing semantic trajectory clustering algorithms only consider the local semantic relationship between adjacent spatio-temporal trajectories, and the overall global semantic relationship between trajectories is still unknown. Considering the disadvantages of the current trajectory clustering methods, we proposed a novel algorithm for semantic trajectory clustering based on community detection (STCCD) in networks, which can better measure the semantic similarity of trajectories and capture global relationship among trajectories from the perspective of the network, and can get better trajectory clustering results compared to some traditional and recently proposed methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mine the trajectory clustering information and related knowledge from the semantic trajectory data.},

	abstract = {Ontologies enhances the semantics by providing richer relationships between the terms of a vocabulary. Ontologies are usually expressed in a logic-based language, so that detailed and meaningful distinctions can be made among the classes, properties, and relations. Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a standard ontology description language, built on the Resource Description Framework(RDF). A key argument for modeling knowledge in ontologies is the easy re-use and re-engineering of the knowledge. However, beside consistency checking (e.g Pellet, HermiT, FacT++, RacerPro), current ontology engineering tools provide only basic functionalities for analyzing ontologies. Since ontologies can be considered as graphs(labeled, directed), graph analysis techniques are a suitable answer for this need. There are only very few social network analysis(SNA) applications up to now, and virtually none for analyzing the structure of ontologies. In my thesis I would like to propose the usage of existing state-of-the-art network statistics(e.g to measure Centrality,Cohesion) and algorithm (CPM algorithm) in a domain of ontologies to understand their structure, extract the hidden communities of ontologies and visualize them in a tourism sector.},

	abstract = {Trajectory pattern mining is becoming increasingly popular because of the development of ubiquitous computing technology. Trajectory data contain abundant semantic and geographic information that reflects people’s movement patterns, i.e., who is performing a certain type of activity when and where. However, the variety and complexity of people’s movement activity and the large size of trajectory datasets make it difficult to mine valuable trajectory patterns. Moreover, most existing trajectory similarity measurements only consider a portion of the information contained in trajectory data. The patterns obtained cannot be interpreted well in terms of both semantic meaning and geographic distributions. As a result, these patterns cannot be used accurately for recommendation systems or other applications. This paper introduces a novel concept of the semantic-geographic pattern that considers both semantic and geographic meaning simultaneously. A flexible density-based clustering algorithm with a new trajectory similarity measurement called semantic intensity is used to mine these semantic-geographic patterns. Comparative experiments on check-in data from the Sina Weibo service demonstrate that semantic intensity can effectively measure both semantic and geographic similarities among trajectories. The resulting patterns are more accurate and easy to interpret.},

	title = {Semantic {Trajectories}: {Computing} and {Understanding} {Mobility} {Data}},
	shorttitle = {Semantic {Trajectories}},
	abstract = {Thanks to the rapid development of mobile sensing technologies (like GPS, GSM, RFID, accelerometer, gyroscope, sound and other sensors in smartphones), the large-scale capture of evolving positioning data (called mobility data or trajectories) generated by moving objects with embedded sensors has become easily feasible, both technically and economically. We have already entered a world full of trajectories. The state-of-the-art on trajectory, either from the moving object database area or in the statistical analysis viewpoint, has built a bunch of sophisticated techniques for trajectory data ad-hoc storage, indexing, querying and mining etc. However, most of these existing methods mainly focus on a spatio-temporal viewpoint of mobility data, which means they analyze only the geometric movement of trajectories (e.g., the raw ‹x, y, t› sequential data) without enough consideration on the high-level semantics that can better understand the underlying meaningful movement behaviors. Addressing this challenging issue for better understanding movement behaviors from the raw mobility data, this doctoral work aims at providing a high-level modeling and computing methodology for semantically abstracting the rapidly increasing mobility data. Therefore, we bring top-down semantic modeling and bottom-up data computing together and establish a new concept called "semantic trajectories" for mobility data representation and understanding. As the main novelty contribution, this thesis provides a rich, holistic, heterogeneous and application-independent methodology for computing semantic trajectories to better understand mobility data at different levels. In details, this methodology is composed of five main parts with dedicated contributions. Semantic Trajectory Modeling. By investigating trajectory modeling requirements to better understand mobility data, this thesis first designs a hybrid spatio-semantic trajectory model that represents mobility with rich data abstraction at different levels, i.e., from the low-level spatio-temporal trajectory to the intermediate-level structured trajectory, and finally to the high-level semantic trajectory. In addition, a semantic based ontological framework has also been designed and applied for querying and reasoning on trajectories. Offline Trajectory Computing. To utilize the hybrid model, the thesis complementarily designs a holistic trajectory computing platform with dedicated algorithms for reconstructing trajectories at different levels. The platform can preprocess collected mobility data (i.e., raw movement tracks like GPS feeds) in terms of data cleaning/compression etc., identify individual trajectories, and segment them into structurally meaningful trajectory episodes. Therefore, this trajectory computing platform can construct spatio-temporal trajectories and structured trajectories from the raw mobility data. Such computing platform is initially designed as an offline solution which is supposed to analyze past trajectories via a batch procedure. Trajectory Semantic Annotation. To achieve the final semantic level for better understanding mobility data, this thesis additionally designs a semantic annotation platform that can enrich trajectories with third party sources that are composed of geographic background information and application domain knowledge, to further infer more meaningful semantic trajectories. Such annotation platform is application-independent that can annotate various trajectories (e.g., mobility data of people, vehicle and animals) with heterogeneous data sources of semantic knowledge (e.g., third party sources in any kind of geometric shapes like point, line and region) that can help trajectory enrichment. Online Trajectory Computing. In addition to the offline trajectory computing for analyzing past trajectories, this thesis also contributes to dealing with ongoing trajectories in terms of real-time trajectory computing from movement data streams. The online trajectory computing platform is capable of providing real-life trajectory data cleaning, compression, and segmentation over streaming movement data. In addition, the online platform explores the functionality of online tagging to achieve fully semantic-aware trajectories and further evaluate trajectory computing in a real-time setting. Mining Trajectories from Multi-Sensors. Previously, the focus is on computing semantic trajectories using single-sensory data (i.e., GPS feeds), where most datasets are from moving objects with wearable GPS-embedded sensors (e.g., mobility data of animal, vehicle and people tracking). In addition, we explore the problem of mining people trajectories using multi-sensory feeds from smartphones (GPS, gyroscope, accelerometer etc). The research results reveal that the combination of two sensors (GPS+accelerometer) can significantly infer a complete life-cycle semantic trajectories of people's daily behaviors, both outdoor movement via GPS and indoor activities via accelerometer},

As vast amounts of digital traces of human behaviour become available, an opportunity arises to improve mobility models by integrating into them proxy data on mobility collected by a variety of digital platforms and location-aware services. Here we propose a hybrid model of human mobility that integrates a large-scale publicly available dataset from a popular photo-sharing system with the classical gravity model, under a stacked regression procedure. We validate the performance and generalizability of our approach using two ground-truth datasets on air travel and daily commuting in the United States: using two diﬀerent cross-validation schemes we show that the hybrid model aﬀords enhanced mobility prediction at both spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Reliable travel behavior data is a prerequisite for transportation planning process. In large tourism dependent cities, tourists are the most dynamic population group whose size and travel choices remain unknown to planners. Traditional travel surveys generally observe resident travel behavior and rarely target tourists. Ubiquitous uses of social media platforms in smartphones have created a tremendous opportunity to gather digital traces of tourists at a large scale. In this paper, we present a framework on how to use location-based data from social media to gather and analyze travel behavior of tourists. We have collected data of about 67,000 users from Twitter using its search interface for Florida. We ﬁrst propose several ﬁltering steps to create a reliable sample from the collected Twitter data. An ensemble classiﬁcation technique is proposed to classify tourists and residents from user coordinates. The accuracy of the proposed classiﬁer has been compared against the state-of-the-art classiﬁcation methods. Finally, diﬀerent clustering methods have been used to ﬁnd the spatial patterns of destination choices of tourists. Promising results have been found from the output clusters as they reveal most popular tourist spots as well as some of the emerging tourist attractions in Florida. Performance of the proposed clustering techniques has been assessed using internal clustering validation indices. We have analyzed temporal patterns of tourist and resident activities to validate the classiﬁcation of the users in two separate groups of tourists and residents. Proposed ﬁltering, identiﬁcation, and clustering techniques will be signiﬁcantly useful for building individual-level tourist travel demand models from social media data.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method that analyzes the location log data of multiple users to recommend locations to be visited. The method uses our new topic model, called Geo Topic Model, that can jointly estimate both the user’s interests and activity area hosting the user’s home, ofﬁce and other personal places. By explicitly modeling geographical features of locations and users, the user’s interests in other features of locations, which we call latent topics, can be inferred effectively. The topic interests estimated by our model 1) lead to high accuracy in predicting visit behavior as driven by personal interests, 2) make possible the generation of recommendations when the user is in an unfamiliar area (e.g. sightseeing), and 3) enable the recommender system to suggest an interpretable representation of the user proﬁle that can be customized by the user. Experiments are conducted using real location logs of landmark and restaurant visits to evaluate the recommendation performance of the proposed method in terms of the accuracy of predicting visit selections. We also show that our model can estimate latent features of locations such as art, nature and atmosphere as latent topics, and describe each user’s preference based on them.},

The advance in information and communication technology (ICT) and the surge in user-generated contents (UGC) provide great opportunities to facilitate trip planning. This paper proposes a travel-planning tool by crowdsourcing multiple UGCs to provide customized information for tourists. We harvested hotel customer reviews from TripAdvisor, photo information from Flickr, and travel costs between destinations from Uber. First, we used geospatial data mining approaches to extract tourism attractions information from Flickr; identiﬁed multi-facet characteristics of hotels with natural language processing (NLP); and provided travel route recommendations with graph analysis. Second, we developed a web-based interface to let users communicate with the system interactively, which provides integrated recommendations including attractions, hotels, and visit route sequences. Two cities in the United States (i.e. Atlanta and Chicago) were used as cases to illustrate our approaches. The proposed travel planning tool is not only beneﬁcial to support customized travel decision-making, but also supportive for hotel managers with strategic management implications.},

	abstract = {Urban areas of interest (AOI) refer to the regions within an urban environment that attract people’s attention. Such areas often have high exposure to the general public, and receive a large number of visits. As a result, urban AOI can reveal useful information for city planners, transportation analysts, and location-based service providers to plan new business, extend existing infrastructure, and so forth. Urban AOI exist in people’s perception and are defined by behaviors. However, such perception was rarely captured until the Social Web information technology revolution. Social media data record the interactions between users and their surrounding environment, and thus have the potential to uncover interesting urban areas and their underlying spatiotemporal dynamics. This paper presents a coherent framework for extracting and understanding urban AOI based on geotagged photos. Six different cities from six different countries have been selected for this study, and Flickr photo data covering these cities in the past ten years (2004 - 2014) have been retrieved. We identify AOI using DBSCAN clustering algorithm, understand AOI by extracting distinctive textual tags and preferable photos, and discuss the spatiotemporal dynamics as well as some insights derived from the AOI. An interactive prototype has also been implemented as a proof-of-concept. While Flickr data have been used in this study, the presented framework can also be applied to other geotagged photos.},

Most often, this information appears in the full-text article contents as a description in natural language including place names, with no accompanying machine-readable geographic metadata. Automatically extracting this geographic information could help conduct meta-analyses, find geographical research gaps, and retrieve articles using spatial search criteria. Research on this problem is still in its infancy, with many works manually processing corpora for locations and few cross-domain studies. In this paper, we develop a fully automatic pipeline to extract and represent relevant locations from scientific articles, applying it to two varied corpora. We obtain good performance, with full pipeline precision of 0.84 for an environmental corpus, and 0.78 for a biomedical corpus. Our results can be visualized as simple global maps, allowing human annotators to both explore corpus patterns in space and triage results for downstream analysis. Future work should not only focus on improving individual pipeline components, but also be informed by user needs derived from the potential spatial analysis and exploration of such corpora.},

The nature of errors and imprecision in tagging and georeferencing are quantified, and automatically generated precision measures appear to mirror errors in the positioning of images. Users seek to ascribe appropriate semantics to images, though bulk-uploading and bulk-tagging may introduce bias. Between 0.5–2\% of tags associated with georeferenced images analyzed describe city core areas generically, while 70\% of all georeferenced images analyzed include specific place name tags, with place names at the granularity of city names being by far the most common. Using Flickr metadata, it is possible not only to describe the use of the term Downtown across the USA, but also to explore the borders of city center neighborhoods at the level of individual cities, whilst accounting for bias by the use of tag profiles.},

Point of interest (POI) and region of interest (ROI) are signiﬁcant reference data that are widely used in geospatial applications. This study aims to develop an efﬁcient method for POI/ROI discovery from Flickr. Attractive footprints in photos with a local maximum that is beneﬁcial for distinguishing clusters are ﬁrst exploited. Pattern discovery is combined with a novel algorithm, the spatial overlap (SO) algorithm, and the naming and merging method is conducted for attractive footprint clustering. POI and ROI, which are derived from the peak value and range of clusters, indicate the most popular location and range for appreciating attractions. The discovered ROIs have a particular spatial overlap available which means the satisﬁed region of ROIs can be shared for appreciating attractions. The developed method is demonstrated in two study areas in Taiwan: Tainan and Taipei, which are the oldest and densest cities, respectively. Results show that the discovered POI/ROIs nearly match the ofﬁcial data in Tainan, whereas more commercial POI/ROIs are discovered in Taipei by the algorithm than ofﬁcial data. Meanwhile, our method can address the clustering issue in a dense area.},

As a type of user-generated data, wisdom of the crowd is embedded inside such social media. In particular, millions of users upload to Flickr their photos, many associated with temporal and geographical information. In this paper, we investigate how to rank the trajectory patterns mined from the uploaded photos with geotags and timestamps. The main objective is to reveal the collective wisdom recorded in the seemingly isolated photos and the individual travel sequences reﬂected by the geo-tagged photos. Instead of focusing on mining frequent trajectory patterns from geo-tagged social media, we put more eﬀort into ranking the mined trajectory patterns and diversifying the ranking results. Through leveraging the relationships among users, locations and trajectories, we rank the trajectory patterns. We then use an exemplar-based algorithm to diversify the results in order to discover the representative trajectory patterns. We have evaluated the proposed framework on 12 diﬀerent cities using a Flickr dataset and demonstrated its eﬀectiveness.},

Stretching of sequences in time is allowed, as well as global translation of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that compute these similarity measures are also provided. We compare these new methods to the widely used Euclidean and time warping distance functions (for real and synthetic data) and show the superiority of our approach, especially in the strong presence of noise.

Using manual annotation we assigned content as toponyms (location), landscape elements (locale) and feelings (sense of place). Flickr tags contained more toponyms than free-listing data, but almost no information relating to feelings. Landscape elements were prominent in both data sets, with those captured by free lists and Flickr being cognitively more salient than those only captured by free listing, suggesting they represent basic levels. In Flickr, landscape elements consisted of basic levels in different languages (e.g. mountain, Berg), while free lists contained landscape elements both at the basic and subordinate level (e.g. Arvenwälder, arolla pine forests).

For that, we analyze the behavior of tourists and residents in four popular cities around the world in four continents: London, New York, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo. We perform a spatio-temporal study of properties of the behavior of these two classes of users (tourists and residents). We have identiﬁed, for instance, that some locations have features that are more correlated with the tourists’ behavior, and also that even in places frequented by tourists and residents there are clear distinction in the patterns of behavior of these groups of users. Our study also enables to identify which and when sights are popular. Our results could be useful in several cases, for example, to help in the development of new place recommendation systems for tourists, or to help city planners to better support tourists in their cities.},

However, conventional tourism research methods are not either scalable or cost-efficient to discover underlying movement patterns due to the massive datasets. With advances in information and communication technology, social media platforms provide big data sets generated by millions of people from different countries, all of which can be harvested cost efficiently. This paper introduces a graph-based method to detect tourist movement patterns from Twitter data. First, collected tweets with geotags are cleaned to filter those not published by tourists. Second, a DBSCAN-based clustering method is adapted to construct tourist graphs consisting of the tourist attraction vertices and edges. Third, network analytical methods (e.g. betweenness centrality, Markov clustering algorithm) are applied to detect tourist movement patterns, including popular attractions, centric attractions, and popular tour routes. New York City in the United States is selected to demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology. The detected tourist movement patterns assist business and government activities whose mission is tour product planning, transportation, and development of both shopping and accommodation centers.},

This paper explores the capacity of one increasingly prevalent source of these data, geographically encoded photographs, to capture spatial expressions of place in an urban environment. Geotagged photographs were obtained from the Flickr API to build a geographic database of photographs for the city of Vancouver, Canada from 2001–2012. These data were aggregated to multiple geographic units represented as hexagonal lattices. Spatial patterns of photo aggregation were examined for tessellations that ranged from 0.25 ha to 1024 ha. Tags associated with each photo were also explored through the notion of ‘tag-space’ at multiple resolutions, or ‘‘scales’’, of analysis through local log-odds ratios. Results indicate a signiﬁcant interaction between tag-space semantics and spatial aggregation which suggests that consideration of scale effects should be integral to analysis of this type of tagged VGI for exploring citizens’ sensing of urban environments. The results indicate further that we may have to reconsider the interaction between encoded meaning, the methods used for extracting such meaning from tag-space, and exogenous and endogenous spatial scales of spatial UGC.},

	abstract = {This paper employs deep learning in detecting the traffic accident from social media data. First, we thoroughly investigate the 1-year over 3 million tweet contents in two metropolitan areas: Northern Virginia and New York City. Our results show that paired tokens can capture the association rules inherent in the accident-related tweets and further increase the accuracy of the traffic accident detection. Second, two deep learning methods: Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are investigated and implemented on the extracted token. Results show that DBN can obtain an overall accuracy of 85\% with about 44 individual token features and 17 paired token features. The classification results from DBN outperform those of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and supervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA). Finally, to validate this study, we compare the accident-related tweets with both the traffic accident log on freeways and traffic data on local roads from 15,000 loop detectors. It is found that nearly 66\% of the accident-related tweets can be located by the accident log and more than 80\% of them can be tied to nearby abnormal traffic data. Several important issues of using Twitter to detect traffic accidents have been brought up by the comparison including the location and time bias, as well as the characteristics of influential users and hashtags.},

Individuals have varied degrees of agency in initiating, reacting to or modifying the course of events, and reactions include observations of occurrence, expressions containing sentiment or emotions, or a call to action. Key characteristics of reactions include referent events and information about who reacted, when, where and how. Collective reactions are composed of multiple individual reactions sharing common referents. They can be characterized according to the following dimensions: spatial, temporal, social, thematic and interlinkage. We present a conceptual framework, which allows characterization and comparison of collective reactions. For a thematically well-deﬁned class of event such as storms, we can explore diﬀerences and similarities in collective attribution of meaning across space and time. Other events may have very complex spatio-temporal signatures (e.g. political processes such as Brexit or elections), which can be decomposed into series of individual events (e.g. a temporal window around the result of a vote). The purpose of our framework is to explore ways in which collective reactions to events in LBSM can be described and underpin the development of methods for analysing and understanding collective reactions to events.},

	abstract = {Computing trajectory similarity is a fundamental operation in movement analytics, required in search, clustering, and classification of trajectories, for example. Yet the range of different but interrelated trajectory similarity measures can be bewildering for researchers and practitioners alike. This paper describes a systematic comparison and methodical exploration of trajectory similarity measures. Specifically, this paper compares five of the most important and commonly used similarity measures: dynamic time warping (DTW), edit distance (EDR), longest common subsequence (LCSS), discrete Fréchet distance (DFD), and Fréchet distance (FD). The paper begins with a thorough conceptual and theoretical comparison. This comparison highlights the similarities and differences between measures in connection with six different characteristics, including their handling of a relative versus absolute time and space, tolerance to outliers, and computational efficiency. The paper further reports on an empirical evaluation of similarity in trajectories with contrasting properties: data about constrained bus movements in a transportation network, and the unconstrained movements of wading birds in a coastal environment. A set of four experiments: a. creates a measurement baseline by comparing similarity measures to a single trajectory subjected to various transformations; b. explores the behavior of similarity measures on network-constrained bus trajectories, grouped based on spatial and on temporal similarity; c. assesses similarity with respect to known behavioral annotations (flight and foraging of oystercatchers); and d. compares bird and bus activity to examine whether they are distinguishable based solely on their movement patterns. The results show that in all instances both the absolute value and the ordering of similarity may be sensitive to the choice of measure. In general, all measures were more able to distinguish spatial differences in trajectories than temporal differences. The paper concludes with a high-level summary of advice and recommendations for selecting and using trajectory similarity measures in practice, with conclusions spanning our three complementary perspectives: conceptual, theoretical, and empirical.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The increasing popularity of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) and the semantic enrichment of mobility data in several contexts in the last years has led to the generation of large volumes of trajectory data. In contrast to GPS-based trajectories, LBSN and context-aware trajectories are more complex data, having several semantic textual dimensions besides space and time, which may reveal interesting mobility patterns. For instance, people may visit different places or perform different activities depending on the weather conditions. These new semantically rich data, known as multiple-aspect trajectories, pose new challenges in trajectory classification, which is the problem that we address in this paper. Existing methods for trajectory classification cannot deal with the complexity of heterogeneous data dimensions or the sequential aspect that characterizes movement. In this paper we propose MARC, an approach based on attribute embedding and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for classifying multiple-aspect trajectories, that tackles all trajectory properties: space, time, semantics, and sequence. We highlight that MARC exhibits good performance especially when trajectories are described by several textual/categorical attributes. Experiments performed over four publicly available datasets considering the Trajectory-User Linking (TUL) problem show that MARC outperformed all competitors, with respect to accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.},

However, recent proposals have used background geographic information and social media data to enrich these trajectories with a semantic dimension, giving rise to the concept of semantic trajectories. Only a few works have proposed similarity measures for semantic trajectories or multidimensional sequences, having limitations such as predefined weight of the dimensions, sensitivity to noise, tolerance for gaps with different sizes, and the prevalence of the worst dimension similarity. In this article we propose MSM, a novel similarity measure for multidimensional sequences that overcomes the aforementioned limitations by considering and weighting the similarity in all dimensions. MSM is evaluated through an extensive experimental study that, based on a seed trajectory, creates sets of semantic trajectories with controlled transformations to introduce different kinds and levels of dissimilarity. For each set, we compute the similarity between the seed and the transformed trajectories, using different measures. The results showed that MSM was more robust and efficient than related approaches in the domain of semantic trajectories.},

Issues revolving around location privacy—or geoprivacy—therefore concern the vast majority of the population, largely without knowing how the underlying technologies work and what can be inferred from an individual’s location (especially if recorded over longer periods of time). Research, on the other hand, has largely treated this topic from isolated standpoints, most prominently from the technological and ethical points of view. This article therefore reflects upon the current state of geoprivacy from a broader perspective. It integrates technological, ethical, legal, and educational aspects and clarifies how they interact and shape how we deal with the corresponding technology, both individually and as a society. It does so in the form of a manifesto, consisting of 21 theses that summarize the main arguments made in the article. These theses argue that location information is different from other kinds of personal information and, in combination, show why geoprivacy (and privacy in general) needs to be protected and should not become a mere illusion. The fictional couple of Jane and Tom is used as a running example to illustrate how common it has become to share our location information, and how it can be used—both for good and for worse.},

In this review, smart transportation is considered to be an umbrella term that covers route optimization, parking, street lights, accident prevention/detection, road anomalies, and infrastructure applications. The purpose of this paper is to make a self-contained review of ML techniques and IoT applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and obtain a clear view of the trends in the aforementioned ﬁelds and spot possible coverage needs. From the reviewed articles it becomes profound that there is a possible lack of ML coverage for the Smart Lighting Systems and Smart Parking applications.

This paper proposes a model of spatio-temporal accessibility to EMS called ST-E2SFCA based on adapting the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. We apply our method to the greater Tokyo area for a large volume of GPS dataset with millions of users and compare the accessibility difference over space and time. To evaluate our model, we also analyze the distinction of our model over different weight sets and compare the performance of ST-E2SFCA with the traditional E2SFCA. The result shows that our method can illustrate the temporal difference and is suitable for measuring the spatio-temporal accessibility to EMS, thus can guide the hospital location selection and urban planning.},

	abstract = {Significance
            To manage the current epidemic, policymakers need tools that help them in evidence-based decision making. In particular, decision support is needed to assess policy measures by their ability to enforce social distancing. A solution is offered by our work: We use mobility data derived from telecommunication metadata as a proxy for social distancing, and, based on this, we demonstrate how the effect of policy measures can be monitored in a nationwide setting. Compared to the status quo, this provides a clear benefit: Monitoring policy measures through case counts has a substantial time lag, whereas our approach allows for monitoring in near real time.
          , 
            
              In response to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), governments have introduced severe policy measures with substantial effects on human behavior. Here, we perform a large-scale, spatiotemporal analysis of human mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic. We derive human mobility from anonymized, aggregated telecommunication data in a nationwide setting (Switzerland; 10 February to 26 April 2020), consisting of

              1.5 billion trips. In comparison to the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by 49.1\%. The strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than five people, which are estimated to have decreased mobility by 24.9\%, followed by venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars) and school closures. As such, human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7 to 13 d ahead. A 1\% reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88 to 1.11\% reduction in daily reported COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via telecommunication data can support public decision makers in two ways. First, it helps in assessing policy impact; second, it provides a scalable tool for near real-time epidemic surveillance, thereby enabling evidence-based policies.},

Only when spatial technologies such as GIS are understood as part of a nexus of relations which includes academia in the commodification of information can GIS practice by fully analyzed. A four-stage sequence of ethical practice is proposed, in which GIS has achieved the second stage. GIS practice and use is a fluctuating, contested area, which, therefore, is not suited to a rigid code of ethics. A better approach is based in the internalist and externalist dialectic.},

By permitting organizational boundaries to become permeable, firms have started to allow the in-and outflow of knowledge to enable new forms of value creation. This also applies to data as a form of knowledge. Yet, firms still struggle to systematically evaluate the benefits of engaging in open data initiatives. Hence, a comprehensive and empirically grounded model is needed. Therefore, we apply an exploratory research approach by triangulating insights from a literature review, expert interviews, and multiple case studies to derive three clusters of benefit concepts: internal improvements, innovation driver, and visibility \& participation. Our work contributes to a better understanding of open data and lays the foundation for quantitative empirical studies. For practitioners, we outline a novel path to extract value from data and, hence, call for additional investments into open data initiatives.},

Datasets can contain more than 2000 location events per person per day and can observe hundreds of thousands of participants with no response burden. Hence, such datasets are very attractive for transport modelling, particularly on a regional level. However, privacy regulations make accessing, working with, and sharing such data challenging. We propose an approach for the generation of open, synthetic mobile phone traces, based on a small sample of network traces, information on the location of the network antennas, and activity patterns from a MATSim scenario. Such datasets will allow for better collaboration between researchers on the development of new algorithms for extracting travel plans and other indicators. Previous approaches only generated synthetic traces for CDR (Call detail record) data, which contains many less data points than traces from 3G and 4G networks. The method accommodates diﬀerent network types (GSM, 3G, 4G etc), and the introduction of important data artefacts such as pinging and loss of reception. Using the proposed method, a the ﬁrst steps towards a synthetic network trace dataset for Switzerland calibrated from Austrian network traces is presented.},

As such, only very few take advantage of temporal consistency in video sequences, and those that do only impose weak smoothness constraints across consecutive frames. In this paper, we advocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive images and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly regressing. This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding the conservation of the number of people. As a result, it significantly boosts performance without requiring a more complex architecture. Furthermore, it also enables us to exploit the correlation between people flow and optical flow to further improve the results.

While we find that 67 percent of respondents are willing to install an app from at least one of the eight providers included, the factors that predict one’s willingness to adopt differ.

MAUP, long acknowledged, remains unresolved. We present an exploratory spatial data analytical approach (ESDA) to understand the scalar effects of MAUP. To characterize relationships between data aggregation structures and spatial scales, we develop a method for statistically and visually exploring the local indicators of spatial association (LISA) exhibited between a variable and itself across varying levels of aggregation. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing the across-scale relationships of aggregated 2010 median income for the State of Pennsylvania and 2005–2009 cancer diagnosis rates for the State of New York between county–tract, tract–block group, and county–block group level US census designated enumeration units. This method for understanding the relationship between MAUP and spatial scale provides guidance to researchers in selecting the most appropriate scales to aggregate, analyze, and represent data for problem-specific analyses.},

We structure our review along the dichotomy of individual versus population-based move­ ment or, using terminology from wildlife ecology, between the Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives. We further introduce a new unifying framework for movement research that is sufficiently gen­ eral to cover any type of movement study in any discipline and that spans the Lagrangian/Eulerian divide, with the ambitious goal to bridge the gap between disciplines and lay a solid foundation for a new Integrated Science of Movement.},

However, the spatial patterns of change in human pressure and their relation to conservation efforts are less well known. We developed a spatially and temporally explicit map of global change in human pressure over 2 decades between 1990 and 2010 at a resolution of 10 km2. We evaluated 22 spatial data sets representing different components of human pressure and used them to compile a temporal human pressure index (THPI) based on 3 data sets: human population density, land transformation, and electrical power infrastructure. We investigated how the THPI within protected areas was correlated to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) management categories and the human development index (HDI) and how the THPI was correlated to cumulative pressure on the basis of the original human footprint index. Since the early 1990s, human pressure increased 64\% of the terrestrial areas; the largest increases were in Southeast Asia. Protected areas also exhibited overall increases in human pressure, the degree of which varied with location and IUCN management category. Only wilderness areas and natural monuments (management categories Ib and III) exhibited decreases in pressure. Protected areas not assigned any category exhibited the greatest increases. High HDI values correlated with greater reductions in pressure across protected areas, while increasing age of the protected area correlated with increases in pressure. Our analysis is an initial step toward mapping changes in human pressure on the natural world over time. That only 3 data sets could be included in our spatio-temporal global pressure map highlights the challenge to measuring pressure changes over time.

time consuming step in the discovery process. In part, it is because database designers do not think about data mining during
the conceptual design of a database, therefore data are not prepared for mining. This problem increases for spatio-temporal
data generated by mobile devices, which involve both space and time. In this paper we propose a novel solution to reduce the
gap between databases and data mining in the domain of trajectories of moving objects, aiming to reduce the effort for data
preprocessing. We propose a general framework for modeling trajectory patterns during the conceptual design of a database.
The proposed framework is a result of several works including different data mining case studies and experiments performed
by the authors on trajectory data modeling and trajectory data mining. It has been validated with a data mining query language
implemented in PostGIS, that allows the user to create, instantiate and query trajectory data and trajectory patterns.

	abstract = {In the wake of Paris agreement, global economies have been putting their full efforts in mitigation and adaption to limit the global temperature within 2 °C higher than the pre-industrial level. Redirection of investment flows to renewable energy technologies (RETs) is paramount to achieve the goals set in global climate agreement. The Turkish government is determined to attract investment in RETs for cleaner energy production and sustainable socio-economic development in Turkey. However, it is very challenging to substitute environmentally harmful traditional energy systems with renewable energy production and supply. Investing in and developing renewable energy projects (REPs) are posed to various inherent risks. Assessment and analysis of risk factors of renewable energy investments (REIs) are indispensable for a practical and profound policy guideline for mitigation. This study provides a Multi-Criteria Decision Methodology (MCDM) based three-stage decision framework to assess and examine the risk factors of REIs in Turkey. The first stage is the identification of risk factors of REI using the Delphi method. The second stage is the assessment of identified risk factors of REI by using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The third stage is the evaluation and prioritization of strategies to overcome risk factors of REI projects by using Fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (FWASPAS). The Delphi method unveiled 6 major risk factors with 23 sub-risk factors. Results of AHP analysis unfolded economic \& business risk as a major risk factor. The FWASPAS analysis concluded a comprehensive and explicit explanation of the RET choices to be the most suitable of six strategies to deal with the investment risk factors for sustainable development in Turkey.},

Howbeit, since risk assessment is dependent on expert opinions, uncertainty in the judgment of the consultants should be avoided. In this study, a novel hybrid failure mode and effect analysis approach is proposed to assess the investment risks of renewable energy projects. Results indicated that wind energy is the most appropriate alternative considering technical, marketability, environmental, economic, social aspects. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis is carried out and the robustness and validity of results from the proposed approach are examined. Finally, six different scenarios are considered and the results are interpreted accordingly. The findings of this study will be valuable to authorities, investors, and enterprises involved in the renewable energy projects and evaluating their investment.},

The PV panels of the existing projects are mounted on a rigid pontoon structure and vary between horizontal and tilted installations. Future concepts proposed for marine and large lacusterine sites are envisaged to incorporate laminated thin film PV, which would allow the structure to be flexible and able to yield with the oncoming waves, and submergible arrays, which would be submerged in harsh weather conditions. Interest and research has been developing in this niche field throughout the years and has currently reached the megawatt scale with even bigger plans for the future.

Apart from power generation, the system can reduce the water evaporation. Development of FPV power plants requires studying both mechanical and electrical structure of these systems. Many studies have been conducted on FPV systems which have assessed these systems from different points of view. In this paper, an analytical analysis and updated review that studies different aspects of FPV systems as a power generation system is presented. Also, a comparison between the ground mounted and floating PV systems is presented and the gaps of the reviewed subjects are indicated. Furthermore, the applicable FPV array interconnection schemes are discussed and the most favorable reconfiguration schemes for FPV arrays are shown, also multilevel DC-DC converters for grid integration of FPV panels are investigated. Reviewing the articles indicated that the main focus of the researchers was on the experimental study and mechanical investigation of FPV systems as well as the impact of the application of these systems on water evaporation. The present research has a potential to make a contribution to the electrical design and application of FPV panels which are less described in the existing papers.},

	abstract = {Artificial water reservoirs have been created over history for a variety of purposes such as flood control, seasonal water storage for irrigation, fishing, hydropower generation, energy storage, etc. Globally, hydropower represents still the largest share of renewable electricity generation, with over 1170 GW of capacity installed, thereof 328 GW is hydro Run-of-River capacity, and the rest is hydro reservoir based (141 GW of which is hydro pumped storage), controlled to different degrees. These reservoirs cover a surface of approximately 265.7 thousand km2 with the potential to host 4400 GW of floating photovoltaic (PV) power plants at 25\% reservoir surface coverage and generate approximately 6270 TWh of electricity. This capacity can be extended to 5700 GW and about 8000 TWh of electricity if all reservoirs (hydropower and for other purposes) are covered at 25\%, in both cases generating already more electricity than hydropower from reservoirs at about 2510 TWh. The flexibility of operation of hydro reservoir based power plants and their current connection to grids facilitates a “virtual battery” consisting of supplying the electricity demand with solar energy during peak irradiation hours, while balancing grids with hydropower during low/no irradiation times and providing a zero impact area for PV power plant deployment. The characteristics of the “virtual battery” are investigated and presented in this study. The PV power plants also could prevent approximately 74 billion m3 of water evaporation, further benefiting hydropower production and water conservation, increasing water availability by an estimated 6.3\%, adding an estimated 142.5 TWh of production to reservoir-based hydropower plants.},

	doi = {10.5075/epfl-cisbat2015-555-560},
	abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment on existing building roof-tops has proven to be one of the most viable large scale resources of sustainable energy for urban areas. While there have been many studies on roof-top integrated PV systems at building and neighborhood scale, estimating the PV energy potential through the available roof surface area in large scale, however, remains a challenge. This study proposes a methodology to estimate the roof-top solar PV potential for existing buildings at the commune level (the smallest administrative division) in Switzerland. In addition, while several studies suggest physical models to assess the photovoltaic solar energy potential, the current study proposes a computational data-based learning approach, using the following four steps: (1) monthly estimation of the main solar irradiance components (global horizontal, direct normal, diffuse horizontal) for the entire Switzerland, that is, the total amount of solar energy available from the Sun (2) processing of training and testing population and building data at a commune level, (3) estimation of the available roof-top surface (AR), average roof tilted angle (), and average shading coeffcient (S) for buildings in the urban areas, for each commune, (4) combination of the available roof-top surface area for each commune with the solar potential along with other parameters so as to estimate the actual solar PV potential. The first step is achieved through a Support Vector Regression (SVR), using solar irradiance satellite data with an average RMSE of 1.68 W/m2. In the second step, GIS have been used to aggregate the data at a commune level. In the third step, a supervised learning algorithm using SVR has been used so as to estimate AR, β, and S in existing buildings, which can be extremely difficult data to obtain at a large scale. We use (i) population and building density data, (ii) land use data, and (iii) building typologies as input features. Aggregated values for AR, β and S for 46 communes in Geneva canton are used as a training output (labeled data) for the learning process. Finally, in the fourth step, by combining solar irradiance and building parameters predictions, we estimate the solar PV potential at the national scale},

Electricity markets are transitioning towards renewable sources such as hydro, wind and solar. The latter two could produce a mismatch between demand and supply. Combining renewables with storage is one way to address this challenge. This paper analyzes the feasibility of 100\% renewable generation in Switzerland. We consider hydro and PV generation, combined with pumped hydro storage, to address the timing problem between demand and PV generation. We explore several combinations of installed solar capacity, reservoir levels and pumping capacity. Our findings indicate that given current technological development, Switzerland would need to double its pumping capacity, increase solar generation capacity by a factor between 13 and 25, while increasing reservoir size up to 100\% depending on the installed solar capacity.},

The estimation for new hydropower production is 25\% of all new renewables primarily due to potential in China, Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia. Also in Europe a growth of hydropower production is aimed to achieve emission targets within the European Union by 2050. However, one of the main economic, technical and ecological challenges in future are the deposition, the treatment, and the disturbed dynamics of sediments in river catchments, which reduce the future market potential of hydropower substantially. Due to a lack in awareness of those sedimentological challenges (e.g. lack of process understanding), various huge economical, technical and ecological problems emerge with an increasing relevance for hydropower industry, water management authorities and the society in future. Based on a substantial literature review, (i) legal frameworks and (ii) reservoir management techniques including (iii) process understanding and numerical modelling are addressed in this article. Moreover, the relevant cost-effective aspects of abrasion are worked out for (iv) turbine runners and (v) sediment bypass systems as well as the (vi) the ecological relevance of sediments and possible disturbances are described in this manuscript to open a future discussion on technical opportunities. It was concluded, that all these issues should be addressed within the framework of the overall aim to minimize the costs under consideration of ecological requirements and standards by an improved sediment management in terms of hydropower use. Moreover, it was stated that trans- and interdisciplinary research is required, to achieve those aims in future.},

However, in traditional social science, it is practically difficult to collect large-scale user behavior data. Fortunately, with the ubiquity of smartphones and Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs), users continuously report their activities online, which massively reflect their collective behavior. In this paper, we propose NationTelescope, a platform that monitors, compares and visualizes large-scale nation-wide user behavior in LBSNs. First, it continuously collects user behavior data from LBSNs. Second, it automatically generates behavior data summary and integrates an interactive map interface for data visualization. Third, in order to compare and visualize the behavioral differences across countries, it detects the discriminative activities according to the related traffic patterns in different countries. By implementing a prototype of NationTelescope platform, we evaluate its effectiveness and usability via two case studies and a system usability scale survey. The results show that the platform can not only efficiently capture, compare and visualize nation-wide collective behavior, but also achieve good usability and user experience.},

	abstract = {Culture has been recognized as a driving impetus for human development. It co-evolves with both human belief and behavior. When studying culture, Cultural Mapping is a crucial tool to visualize different aspects of culture (e.g., religions and languages) from the perspectives of indigenous and local people. Existing cultural mapping approaches usually rely on large-scale survey data with respect to human beliefs, such as moral values. However, such a data collection method not only incurs a significant cost of both human resources and time, but also fails to capture human behavior, which massively reflects cultural information. In addition, it is practically difficult to collect large-scale human behavior data. Fortunately, with the recent boom in Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), a considerable number of users report their activities in LBSNs in a participatory manner, which provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to study large-scale user behavioral data. In this article, we propose a participatory cultural mapping approach based on collective behavior in LBSNs. First, we collect the participatory sensed user behavioral data from LBSNs. Second, since only local users are eligible for cultural mapping, we propose a progressive “home” location identification method to filter out ineligible users. Third, by extracting three key cultural features from daily activity, mobility, and linguistic perspectives, respectively, we propose a cultural clustering method to discover cultural clusters. Finally, we visualize the cultural clusters on the world map. Based on a real-world LBSN dataset, we experimentally validate our approach by conducting both qualitative and quantitative analysis on the generated cultural maps. The results show that our approach can subtly capture cultural features and generate representative cultural maps that correspond well with traditional cultural maps based on survey data.},

	abstract = {Planning for active mobility satisfies many fundamental tenets of good urban design and planning. However, planning for active mobility is a complex endeavour due to numerous local, place-based factors that influence active mobility decisions. Recent advancements in urban data research have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning methods in evaluating active mobility potential for urban environments. At present, the incorporation of semantic information from deep learning models and street view imagery into spatio-temporal contexts remains a challenge. In particular, knowledge extraction from deep learning models remains an open question for urban planning and decision-making. Towards this issue, we propose a functional deep learning and network science workflow that employs open data from OpenStreetMap and Mapillary to assess factors affecting active mobility decisions and route planning. We demonstrate the generalisability of our analytical workflow through two case studies focusing on urban greenery in Nerima city (Japan) and urban visual complexity in Pasir Ris town (Singapore). Our results reveal clear patterns of heterogeneity in urban streetscapes and identify unevenness in street infrastructure provision based on destination types. Using this information, we propose specific areas for design intervention to improve active mobility planning. Our workflow is applicable for a diverse range of use cases making it relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, not limited to, urban researchers, policy makers and urban planners.},

This type of information can be valuable not only for browsing, ﬁnding and making sense of individual items, but also in aggregate form to help understand data trends and features. In particular, over twenty million geo-referenced photos are now available on Flickr, a photo-sharing website – the ﬁrst major collection of its kind. These photos are often associated with userentered unstructured text labels (i.e., tags). We show how we analyze the tags associated with the geo-referenced Flickr images to generate aggregate knowledge in the form of “representative tags” for arbitrary areas in the world. We use these tags to create a visualization tool, World Explorer, that can help expose the content of the data, using a map interface to display the derived tags and the original photo items. We perform a qualitative evaluation of World Explorer that outlines the visualization’s beneﬁts in browsing this type of content. We provide insights regarding the aggregate versus individual-item requirements in browsing digital geo-referenced material.},

The social media indexes are constructed from the principal components of these signals. The University of Michigan Social Media Job Loss Index tracks initial claims for unemployment insurance at medium and high frequencies and predicts 15 to 20 percent of the variance of the prediction error of the consensus forecast for initial claims. The social media indexes provide real-time indicators of events such as Hurricane Sandy and the 2013 government shutdown. Comparing the job loss index with the search and posting indexes indicates that the Beveridge Curve has been shifting inward since 2011.

	abstract = {Ontologies enhances the semantics by providing richer relationships between the terms of a vocabulary. Ontologies are usually expressed in a logic-based language, so that detailed and meaningful distinctions can be made among the classes, properties, and relations. Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a standard ontology description language, built on the Resource Description Framework(RDF). A key argument for modeling knowledge in ontologies is the easy re-use and re-engineering of the knowledge. However, beside consistency checking (e.g Pellet, HermiT, FacT++, RacerPro), current ontology engineering tools provide only basic functionalities for analyzing ontologies. Since ontologies can be considered as graphs(labeled, directed), graph analysis techniques are a suitable answer for this need. There are only very few social network analysis(SNA) applications up to now, and virtually none for analyzing the structure of ontologies. In my thesis I would like to propose the usage of existing state-of-the-art network statistics(e.g to measure Centrality,Cohesion) and algorithm (CPM algorithm) in a domain of ontologies to understand their structure, extract the hidden communities of ontologies and visualize them in a tourism sector.},

Combining renewables with storage is one way to address this chal­ lenge. This paper analyzes the feasibility of 100\% renewable generation in Switzerland. We consider hydro and PV generation, combined with pumped hydro storage, to address the timing problem between demand and PV generation. We explore several combinations of installed solar capacity, reservoir levels and pumping capacity. Our findings indicate that given current technological development, Switzerland would need to double its pumping capacity, increase solar generation capacity by a factor between 13 and 25, while increasing reservoir size up to 100\% depending on the installed solar capacity.},

In this paper, we focus on geo-tagged photos and propose a method to detect people's frequent trip patterns, i.e., typical sequences of visited cities and durations of stay as well as descriptive tags that characterize the trip patterns. Our method first segments photo collections into trips and categorizes them based on their trip themes, such as visiting landmarks or communing with nature. Our method mines frequent trip patterns for each trip theme category. We crawled 5.7 million geo-tagged photos and performed photo trip pattern mining. The experimental result shows that our method outperforms other baseline methods and can correctly segment photo collections into photo trips with an accuracy of 78\%. For trip categorization, our method can categorize about 80\% of trips using tags and titles of photos and visited cities as features. Finally, we illustrate interesting examples of trip patterns detected from our dataset and show an application with which users can search frequent trip patterns by querying a destination, visit duration, and trip theme on the trip.},

Subjective components such as emotions and opinions can provide additional alternative information useful in decision making, e.g. in tourism, business, entertainment and the like. Therefore research on effect analysis was carried out by capturing and analyzing georeferenced emotions from user-generated content. An approach was developed for extracting location-based emotions from the written language in the metadata of georeferenced Flickr and Panoramio photos, i.e. from their titles, descriptions and tags. Within this extraction approach various grammatical issues were considered, like negations of words or amplifications. Procedures were developed for modifying the affected emotions, for example for inverting or intensifying them. The approach was applied to the study area of Dresden, Germany. The obtained emotions were documented in emotional maps of geospace as well as in valence-arousal-space originating from psychology.},

One of the central concepts in this framework is the space-time prism, which models individual accessibility to an environment. In this paper, the derivation and manipulation of space-time prism concepts within a geographical information system (GIS) are discussed. The required system inputs and desired outputs are identified and a generic GIS based procedure is presented. Given these basic requirements, issues are discussed which can determine the feasibility of current GIS technology to handle the derivation of space-time prism concepts.},

	abstract = {The rapid accumulation of large-scale driving data represents an opportunity to improve our understanding of driving behavior patterns and driver traveling intentions. However, limited efforts have been devoted to understanding these patterns and the travel intentions behind them. This study proposes a new trajectory topic model (TTM) to explore latent driving patterns from driving trajectory data and to qualitatively analyze drivers’ main traveling intentions. These trajectory data were collected from more than 150,000 commercial vehicles in Fujian Province, China. After data preprocessing, the TTM was then established to decompose trajectory data into various topics with corresponding probabilities, which were correlated to drivers’ preferences. Several experiments conducted in Fuzhou City were performed to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the TTM using a real trajectory dataset. The results show that the TTM could effectively mine users’ driving behavior patterns with topic probability. The model would enable us to understand the context in which drivers travel and learn their individual preferences. It is also beneficial in that it can predict drivers’ behaviors, analyze traffic patterns in an entire city, and even help autonomous vehicles to learn from drivers.},

However, exploring the spatiotemporal text data and characterizing the evolution of topics over time and space are challenging due to the complexity of such data and associated activities. This paper proposes a new approach to exploring the spatiotemporal text data with visual ﬁlters. We introduce a notion of topic trajectory to depict the spatiotemporal evolution of topics. Multiple coordinated visualizations provided in our visualization system enable users to explore topic trajectories and develop their contextual awareness in terms of how information ﬂows across diﬀerent regions. We demonstrate the use of our system with an analysis of a dataset contributed by users of widely used science mapping software CiteSpace.},

Over the past decade, with the advancement of data collection techniques, such as GPS, transit smart cards, and mobile phones, various types of travel trajectory data are increasingly complementing or replacing conventional travel diaries and stated preference data. Other location-aware data are used in studying human movement patterns, such as social network check-in data and banknote dispersal data. Abundance of the emerging trajectory data has driven a new wave of travel behaviour research, and introduced new research problems. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the travel behaviour studies categorised by trajectory data types. Based on the literature review, research challenges are discussed and promising research topics in this ﬁeld are proposed for future studies.},

The ability to geo-locate events in textual reports represents a valuable source of information in many real-world applications such as emergency responses, real-time social media geographical event analysis, understanding location instructions in auto-response systems and more. However, geoparsing is still widely regarded as a challenge because of domain language diversity, place name ambiguity, metonymic language and limited leveraging of context as we show in our analysis. Results to date, whilst promising, are on laboratory data and unlike in wider NLP are often not cross-compared. In this study, we evaluate and analyse the performance of a number of leading geoparsers on a number of corpora and highlight the challenges in detail. We also publish an automatically geotagged Wikipedia corpus to alleviate the dearth of (open source) corpora in this domain.},

The objective of this work is to propose a method for establishing a processing chain to support the geoparsing and geocoding of text documents describing events strongly linked with space and with a frequent use of ﬁne-grain toponyms. The geoparsing part is a Natural Language Processing approach which combines the use of part of speech and syntactico-semantic combined patterns (cascade of transducers). However, the real novelty of this work lies in the geocoding method. The geocoding algorithm is unsupervised and takes proﬁt of clustering techniques to provide a solution for disambiguating the toponyms found in gazetteers, and at the same time estimating the spatial footprint of those other ﬁne-grain toponyms not found in gazetteers. The feasibility of the proposal has been tested with a corpus of hiking descriptions in French, Spanish and Italian.},
